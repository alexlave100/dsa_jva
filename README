Arrays vs linked Lists

--- SPACE ---
- Static array have a fixed size
- Dynamic arrays grow by 50 or 100 % of the size of the array
- Linked lists don't waste memory, but they have to hold a bit more data since each node will contain both the value and the address to the next node in the chain.
- Use arrays if you know the amount of items to store
